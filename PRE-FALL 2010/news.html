														<p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Latino
														  Cultural Center has also received donations from the Latino students of the

														  collect funds for computer supplies. The center has made use of these funds
														  by upgrading the memory in their computer, buying a CD-writer and a scanner.
														  These items are being used to help with the student organizations' web page
														  development. </font></p>
														<p align="left"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">All MIT
